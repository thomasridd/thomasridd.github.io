# Jekyll Test Theme

This is a test to see whether we want to use Jekyll as a static site generator for my next beta to live project.

We don't but that isn't Jekyll's fault.

Much kudos to Matt Couchman who originally built the template for this thing: [mattcouchman.github.com/jekyll-resume](http://mattcouchman.github.com/jekyll-resume)

As Matt puts it - Feel free to tear apart and rebuild as you wish.
